# ICES DATA PORTAL REVAMP
Since the development of the existing ICES data portal, the portfolio of data products at ICES has grown and diversified, technology has brought new opportunities, and the policy landscape has changed. It is therefore time to rethink the user story for the ICES Data Portal, which this short document aims to do.

This repository will support the development of the next generation of http://ecosystemdata.ices.dk/

## Objectives
The ICES Data portal should:
#### a) Be an online searchable catalogue of data managed by ICES
#### b) Present summaries of these data in a map viewer
#### c) Allow downloading of data in known international formats
#### d) Enable downloading detail data in native formats (i.e. DATRAS, Dome views, etc)

## Specific Requirements
### Content discovery
 - A catalogue of the data managed at ICES.
 - Accommodate indicators/data products from existing ICES systems (SAG, DATRAS Indices, bycatch risk, etc)

## Viewing
Accommodate Reference layers (internal and external sourced).
Being able to view the layers (base data, indicator, reference layer) in the map. 
Be able to query the data geospatially (eg using the map to draw an area)
Having a user area to:
- Access restricted layers (eg. specific to a working group).
- Save queries (to view later).
- Upload user layers to view with the ICES layers.

## Downloading
Being able to download the data in the native format or in an international format.
