# ICES DATA PORTAL REVAMP
Since the development of the existing ICES data portal, the portfolio of data products at ICES has grown and diversified, technology has brought new opportunities, and the policy landscape has changed. It is therefore time to rethink the user story for the ICES Data Portal, which this short document aims to do.

This repository will support the development of the next generation of http://ecosystemdata.ices.dk/

Objectives
The ICES Data portal should:
#### a) Be an online searchable catalogue of data managed by ICES
#### b) Present summaries of these data in a map viewer
#### c) Allow downloading of data in known international formats
#### d) Enable downloading detail data in native formats (i.e. DATRAS, Dome views, etc)


## Current draft of the workflow:
